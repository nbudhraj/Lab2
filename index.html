                <h2> <span id="day1">Day 1:</span> "Monday Motivation"</h2>
                <h3>April 5, 2021</h3>
                <p>Like most people, I often dread Mondays, but this Monday was a pleasant surprise, 
                    as I ended up having a somewhat productive day and actually enjoyed going to my lectures. 
                    On Mondays I typically watch my MMW lectures and I also attended my weekly MUS 17 lectures/discussions. 
                    Both classes offerered interesting insights on modern artforms, helping me contextualize the societal implications of art pieces.
                    Today was also a special Monday because the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Men%27s_Basketball_Tournament">NCAA Men's Basketball Championship</a> 
                    was that evening. Although the game was not as entertaining as some of he past tournament games, it was still pretty fun to watch <b>Baylor University</b> dominate <b>Gonzaga University</b>, who were 
                    heavily favored to win the game. Overall, the inspiring stories about Hip-Hop and art I learned during my MUS 17 and MMW 15, along with the 
                    adversities the Baylor basketball team overcame to win the NCAA tournament, provided me with <strong><em>motivation</em> to be on top of my homework for the rest of the week.</strong>

                <h3>April 6, 2021</h3>

                <p>Tuesday was a pretty fun day. Since the weather was nice in the Bay Area, 
                    I was able to go on a quick hike with my sister in between my classes. Usually, I'm a bit more 
                    productive on Tuesday's, but the nice weather was a bit of a <em>distraction</em> and as a result, I also fell behind on some work, which was a bit frustrated. 
                    Although, I probably should have been completing my school work with full focus, I decided to multi-task (professor powell is probs shaking his head at me).
                    I watched the <b>Golden State Warriors</b> game while doing my homework, so once again I gave into tempation of doing things other than my homework. 
                    Along similar lines of temptations, I have attempting to cut out a lot of sugar in my diet, but since I had decided that it would be <i>Temptation Tuesday</i>,
                    I ate some cookies after dinner.

                <h3>April 7, 2021</h3>
                <p>Because I fell behind on work because of my unproductive Tuesday, I made sure that I was 
                    going to be productive on Wednesday. As a result, I got up pretty early and got to work right away. 
                    I finished and submitted my CSE 101 HW, while also making good headway on my CSE 110 lab. I took a quick break to 
                    shoot some hoops at the park with some friends. I then worked on a series of other 
                    assignmens for some of my other classes and ultimately, was proud of the work I accomplished that day. 
                    I continued to remain disciplined and cooked myself some healthy meals that turned out to be pretty tasty. Overall, 
                    <strong>I used this day to get back on track from all the distractions, which was nice! </strong>
